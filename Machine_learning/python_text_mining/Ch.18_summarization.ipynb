       " 'summary': 'Under existing law, the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act, the Veterinary Medical Board licenses and regulates veterinarians and the practice of veterinary medicine.

The bill would require an agency, department, or officer that calls a veterinarian pursuant to these provisions to notify the board of the investigation. The bill would also authorize a veterinarian who is called from another state to care for animals that are affected by an investigation with a temporary shelter facility established only for the purpose of the investigation, which would be exempt from specified registration requirements if it meets specified conditions.',\n",
