      "Output: 다음 원문 내용에 기초한 전략으로 정리하면, 주식시장 변동성이 클 때는 원금 보전과 변동성 관리에 초점을 맞추는 것이 바람직합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 원금 보호를 최우선으로 확보\n",
      "  - 투자는 “연간 순수익이 채권 이자·세금·적립금의 약 3배”가 되도록 하는 등 보호 여유를 충분히 확보하는 방향으로 선택합니다.\n",
      "  - 보호 수준이 커질수록 안정성이 높아집니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 채권 형태의 선택으로 변동성 관리\n",
      "  - 만기까지 오랜 기간이 남은 경우에는 가치 하락의 위험이 커지므로, sinking fund(적립금으로 일정 비율 상환)이나 serial form(매년 일정액의 상환) 중 하나를 채택해 매년 상환액이 기대 depreciation을 능가하도록 만듭니다.\n",
      "  - 결과적으로 매년의 적립금/상환액이 지속적으로 증가하는 여력이 생깁니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 가격 변동(주가 shrinkage)을 피하는 방법\n",
      "  - 만약 가격이 변하지 않는 것이 최우선이라면 부동산 담보 대출(real-estate mortgage)이 가장 안전하다고 제시됩니다. 다만 이는 유통시장에 바로 거래되지 않는 점에 유의해야 합니다.\n",
      "  - 반대로 사업 잉여금의 운용처럼 높은 변동성과 빠른 현금화가 필요한 경우에는 만기까지의 접근이 가격을 파랗게 유지해 주는 단기금융상품(단기채권 등)을 선택하는 것이 바람직합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 유동성과 재무건전성 확보\n",
      "  - 현재자산이 현재부채의 최소 2:1이 되도록 관리하는 것이 바람직합니다(더 강하면 더 좋습니다).\n",
      "  - 순즉시자산(net quick assets)이 본래의 채무를 초과하도록, 특히 채무를 초과하지 않는 범위에서 보유하는 것이 바람직합니다. 부동산이 있다면 부동산 가치의 2/3과 순즉시자산으로 채권을 커버하는 수준까지 구성하면 더 견고합니다.\n",
      "  - indenture(채권 발행계약)상 일정한 여유를 두고 순즉시자산이 채권보다 항상 큰 수준을 유지하도록 하는 사례도 있습니다.\n",

      "- 원금 보호를 최우선으로 확보\n",
      "  - 투자는 “연간 순수익이 채권 이자·세금·적립금의 약 3배”가 되도록 하는 등 보호 여유를 충분히 확보하는 방향으로 선택합니다.\n",
      "  - 보호 수준이 커질수록 안정성이 높아집니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 채권 형태의 선택으로 변동성 관리\n",
      "  - 만기까지 오랜 기간이 남은 경우에는 가치 하락의 위험이 커지므로, sinking fund(적립금으로 일정 비율 상환)이나 serial form(매년 일정액의 상환) 중 하나를 채택해 매년 상환액이 기대 depreciation을 능가하도록 만듭니다.\n",
      "  - 결과적으로 매년의 적립금/상환액이 지속적으로 증가하는 여력이 생깁니다.\n",

      "- 가격 변동(주가 shrinkage)을 피하는 방법\n",
      "  - 만약 가격이 변하지 않는 것이 최우선이라면 부동산 담보 대출(real-estate mortgage)이 가장 안전하다고 제시됩니다. 다만 이는 유통시장에 바로 거래되지 않는 점에 유의해야 합니다.\n",
      "  - 반대로 사업 잉여금의 운용처럼 높은 변동성과 빠른 현금화가 필요한 경우에는 만기까지의 접근이 가격을 파랗게 유지해 주는 단기금융상품(단기채권 등)을 선택하는 것이 바람직합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 유동성과 재무건전성 확보\n",
      "  - 현재자산이 현재부채의 최소 2:1이 되도록 관리하는 것이 바람직합니다(더 강하면 더 좋습니다).\n",
      "  - 순즉시자산(net quick assets)이 본래의 채무를 초과하도록, 특히 채무를 초과하지 않는 범위에서 보유하는 것이 바람직합니다. 부동산이 있다면 부동산 가치의 2/3과 순즉시자산으로 채권을 커버하는 수준까지 구성하면 더 견고합니다.\n",
